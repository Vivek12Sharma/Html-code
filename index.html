    <h1>Artificial Intelligence <br>
    (A>I)</h1><br>
    <p>Artificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the 
        problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.</p>
        <br>
    <h2>What is artificial intelligence?</h2><br>
    <p>While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced
     over the last few decades, John McCarthy offers the following definition in this
      2004 paper (PDF, 106 KB) (link resides outside IBM), " It is the science and engineering 
      of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to
       the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have 
       to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable." </p><br>
       <p>However, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial intelligence
         conversation was denoted by Alan Turing's seminal work, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" 
         (PDF, 89.8 KB) (link resides outside of IBM), which was published in 1950. In this paper, Turing,
          often referred to as the "father of computer science", asks the following question, "Can machines think?"  
          From there, he offers a test, now famously known as the "Turing Test", where a human interrogator would try 
          to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since 
          its publish, it remains an important part of the history of AI as well as an ongoing concept within philosophy
           as it utilizes ideas around linguistics. </p><br>
    <p>Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig then proceeded to publish, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach 
        (link resides outside IBM), becoming one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve into four 
        potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates computer systems on the basis of rationality and thinking vs.
