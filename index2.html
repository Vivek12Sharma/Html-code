    <h1>Artificial intelligence applications :</h1><br>
    <p>There are numerous, real-world applications of AI systems today.
         Below are some of the most common examples: </p><br>
    <p><ul type="a">
        <li><b>Speech recognition:</b> It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), 
        computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses 
        natural language processing (NLP) to process human speech into a written format. 
        Many mobile devices incorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct 
        voice search—e.g. Siri—or provide more accessibility around texting. </li><br>
        <li><b>Customer service: </b> Online virtual agents are replacing human agents along the customer journey. 
        They answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) around topics, like shipping, or provide personalized advice,
         cross-selling products or suggesting sizes for users, changing the way we think about customer engagement 
         across websites and social media platforms. Examples include messaging bots on e-commerce sites with virtual agents, 
         messaging apps, such as Slack and Facebook Messenger, and tasks usually done by virtual assistants and voice assistants.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>Computer vision:</b> This AI technology enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information 
        from digital images, videos and other visual inputs, and based on those inputs, it can take action. This ability
         to provide recommendations distinguishes it from image recognition tasks. Powered by convolutional neural networks,
          computer vision has applications within photo tagging in social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and self-driving
           cars within the automotive industry.  
        </li><br>
        <li><b>Recommendations Engines :</b> Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can help to discover data trends
         that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling strategies. This is used to make relevant add-on recommendations 
         to customers during the checkout process for online retailers.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>Automated stock trading:</b> Designed to optimize stock portfolios, AI-driven high-frequency trading platforms make thousands
             or even millions of trades per day without human intervention.
        </li>
    </ul>
